# Agentic Bootstrap Prompts

This file contains the sequential prompts to help AI agents bootstrap this project from the ground up.

## Phase 1: Project Understanding

```
Analyze the PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file and confirm:
1. Project purpose and goals
2. Target users/systems
3. Key success criteria
4. Technical constraints
```

## Phase 2: Architecture Design

```
Based on the project context:
1. Review ARCHITECTURE.md and propose a high-level system design
2. Identify major components and their interactions
3. Select appropriate technology stack
4. Define data models and storage requirements
5. Document API contracts or interfaces
```

## Phase 3: Implementation Planning

```
Create an implementation roadmap:
1. Break down work into logical modules/features
2. Identify dependencies between components
3. Suggest a reasonable development order
4. Estimate complexity for each module
5. Highlight potential risks or challenges
```

## Phase 4: Scaffold Generation

```
Generate project scaffolding:
1. Create directory structure following best practices
2. Set up build/dependency management (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Configure development tools (linters, formatters, type checkers)
4. Create placeholder files for main components
5. Set up basic tests and CI/CD
```

## Phase 5: Core Implementation

```
Implement core functionality:
1. Start with the most critical path through the system
2. Implement one complete vertical slice (end-to-end)
3. Add tests for implemented features
4. Document code with clear comments and docstrings
5. Ensure code follows CONVENTIONS.md
```

## Phase 6: Validation & Documentation

```
Validate and document:
1. Run all tests and ensure they pass
2. Update README.md with setup and usage instructions
3. Generate API documentation if applicable
4. Create examples or usage demos
5. Document known issues or limitations
```

## Usage for AI Agents

When bootstrapping this project, work through these phases sequentially. After each phase:
- Confirm completion with the user
- Get feedback on the output
- Adjust approach based on feedback before proceeding

Feel free to ask clarifying questions at any point rather than making assumptions.
